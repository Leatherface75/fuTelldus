   Change $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = false; 
   to  $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = true;
5. Change access rights on config.inc.php to chmod 644

6. Enter http://xxx.xxx.x.xx/phpMyAdmin/ (xxx.xxx.x.xx = ip to your synology) in your web browser and you should get a login popup
7. Click OK without username and password and you should get into phpMyAdmin
8. Logout and login with root as username and empty password
   Comment: rekommendation to change and have a password set...
9. Create a database called futelldus (in the tab named Databases and as Collation in the dropdown)
10. Choose the database futelldus and choose tab import

     ' Warning: mysqli::mysqli(): (28000/1045): Access denied for user 'USERNAME'@'localhost' (using password: YES) in /volume1/web/fuTelldus/lib/base.inc.php on line 18 Connect Error: 1045'

14. Open web/fuTelldus/lib/config.inc.php and change to following
	$username 	= "root"; 					// Mysql username
	$password 	= ""; 					// Mysql password if defined
	$db_name 	= "futelldus"; 				// Mysql DB
	
15. Open http://xxx.xxx.x.xx/fuTelldus/ and login with admin/admin
16. Choose edit on your userprofile of the admin user and enter the telldus API keys which you can get on api.telldus.com

17. Choose the tab Sensors and you might get the following error message:
     'Warning: require_once(HTTP/OAuth/Consumer.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /volume1/web/fuTelldus/inc/sensors.php on line 13 Fatal error: require_once(): Failed opening required 'HTTP/OAuth/Consumer.php' (include_path='.:/usr/syno/php/lib/php') in /volume1/web/fuTelldus/inc/sensors.php on line 13'
18. Unpack PEAR_package_fuTelldus.zip in web/fuTelldus and upack it into same folder  (http://www.telldus.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3364&p=20107)
    Comment: This is not the full OAuth extension since it is hard to install the full one on Synology. If OAuth support comes to synology, this step should be unnecessary)
19. Enter sensors tab again and you might get an error 'Fatal error...', in that case you need to restart apache (or the synology station)
20. Recommendation, create a new user and remove admin

========== Setup Scheduling (needed to create shedules and temperature logging ============
21. Create two shell scripts with the names cron_temp_log.sh and cron_schedule.sh in folder /volume1/web/fuTelldus/ with following content
OBS: Important that the file has UNIX style EOL (End Of Line)

22. Create new schedule events in synology scheduler (in control panel) to fetch temperatures and device states
    Choose userdefined script
    Script 1: Should run every 15 minutes with the command /volume1/web/fuTelldus/cron_temp_log_synology.sh and root as user (or someone with correct priviliges)
    Script 2: Should run every 5 minutes with the command /volume1/web/fuTelldus/cron_schedule_synology.sh and root as user (or someone with correct priviliges)
    OBS! If fuTelldus put somewhere else then in fuTelldus folder under the synology web folder, the two scripts must be changed!!
